<h2 class="text-center my-3"><em>…And now for some frequently asked questions!</em></h2>
<div class="container mb-4">
    <h4 class="faq-question">Are you a professional musician?</h4>
    <p class="faq-answer">Yes, professional and full-time!</p>

    <h4 class="faq-question">How do I book you?</h4>
    <p class="faq-answer">Feel free to contact me via the website, call or text me on 07956 256721, email me at <a href="mailto:info@ninaweddingsinger.co.uk">info@ninaweddingsinger.co.uk</a> or message me on Facebook messenger via the link in the footer below. I offer a free consultation, going over all aspects of the music for your big day. I then send you a contract and I request a 30% deposit. The balance is to be paid a week prior to the booking date.</p>

    <h4 class="faq-question">How long do you play for?</h4>
    <p class="faq-answer">For a ceremony I would normally sing for about 20 minutes as your guests arrive and are seated. I then sing for key songs: 1 for the processional as you walk in, 2 more for the singing of the register and another for the recessional, as you walk out as a married couple.  The songs are ideally ones that you have chosen to make your ceremony unique to you and your partner.  Feel free to look at my set lists for ideas!
        </p>
    <p class="faq-answer">For a wedding breakfast, drinks reception or post wedding breakfast/pre evening reception set,  I would normally play for up to an hour and a half.
    This would involve accompanying myself on acoustic guitar and backing tracks doing a selection of feel good ‘live lounge’ style and jazzy well known songs, perfect to create an uplifting wedding ambiance.  </p>
    <p class="faq-answer">I provide a ceremony and an hour drinks reception package, a very popular choice to see you through to the wedding breakfast.</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">For an evening party I usually provide 3 sets of 40 minutes of live music with a full disco in my breaks, taking requests throughout the evening. I can make announcements to help the evening run smoothly i.e cutting the cake, the serving of the buffet and of course the all important first (and last!) dances.  I can also provide background music if required for earlier in the evening and a radio microphone for speeches.</p>
